Hi, I'm Callum King. This is my submission for the UNiDAYS Discount Challenge for the year-long placement (2019/20).


You can open the project by downloading the respository and running the "UNiDAYSchallenge.sln" file in the same directory as this readme to open it in Visual Studio.
You can run the code by either going to Build -> Build Solution in Visual Studio and running the .exe it creates in \x64\Debug.
You can also run it by going to Debug -> Start Debugging in Visual Studio.
If the page is black, and you want to view the code itself, open it by opening the solution explorer (usually on the right-hand side) and selecting the file you want to view.


I approached the problem by firstly creating classes and functions for what I needed to get started.
This included making the Item class as well as some of the functinos to output the store. I created these functions as then they can be easily re-used.
I then continued from there to create the needed classes and functions such as the UnidaysDiscountChallenge class.

I tried to stick to the interface example given to us as much as possible, but I feel like my answer to the challenge is at a good enough standard.


Thanks for the opportunity, I look forward to your response!
