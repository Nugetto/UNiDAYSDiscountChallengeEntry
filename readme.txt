Hi, I'm Callum King. This is my submission for the UNiDAYS Discount Challenge for the year-long placement (2019/20).

You can run the code by downloading the respository and running the "UNiDAYSchallenge.sln" file in the same directory as this readme.

I approached the problem by firstly creating classes and functions for what I needed to get started.
This included making the Item class as well as some of the functinos to output the store. I created these functions as then they can be easily re-used.
I then continued from there to create the needed classes and functions such as the UnidaysDiscountChallenge class.

I tried to stick to the interface example given to us as much as possible, but I feel like my answer to the challenge is at a good enough standard.

Thanks for the opportunity, I look forward to your response!
